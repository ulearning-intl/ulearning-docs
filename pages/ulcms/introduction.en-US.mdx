The Lecture Capture and Video On-Demand Platform focuses on the accumulation and in-depth development of classroom video recording resources. With high-quality lecture capture equipment and technology, it captures every highlight of each class, ensuring a rich repository of teaching resources.

Based on lecture capture videos, the system utilizes AI-driven classroom quality analysis to identify key elements of the teaching process accurately. It can generate scientific teaching pathways while supporting intelligent supervision and class inspections, allowing multiple roles within the university to participate in evaluations and providing comprehensive, objective data support for undergraduate teaching assessments, effectively promoting improvements in teaching methods and enhancing overall teaching quality.

The platform serves as an integrated solution for universities, combining resource accumulation, intelligent analysis, multidimensional assessment, and educational improvement. It also flexibly integrates diverse resources and third-party applications, fully meeting the varied teaching needs of higher education institutions. By doing so, it contributes to improved teaching quality, enables intelligent and scientific teaching management, and provides a solid foundation for raising the overall standard of education.
