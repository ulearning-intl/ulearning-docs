# 1.2 How to View Lecture Playback Details

You can view a teacher’s courses in **“My Courses.”** Courses are synchronized from the school’s academic system, so teachers do not need to create them manually.

Since the system is integrated with the class schedule, lectures are automatically recorded according to the timetable. After the lecture ends, the playback will be generated the same day and synchronized under the teacher’s course.

After the playback is generated, teachers can click to view the lecture playback details.

The video player displays three streams simultaneously: the teacher, the students, and the courseware (note: in some repurposed classrooms, the courseware stream or audio may be missing)

By clicking the sidebar on the left, teachers can view AI Smart Analysis results, including learning content, instructional presentation, instructional behavior, and student behavior. The “Presentation Index” and “Content Clips” features allow quick navigation within the playback.
