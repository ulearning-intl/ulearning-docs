In the “Teacher Review Tasks” module, administrators can click on “Review Rubrics” to view rubrics of different statuses and categories. They can also click the “Add Rubrics” button to create a new review rubric.

The system allows the creation of new review rubrics based on actual business scenarios. Existing rubrics can be activated, modified (rubrics in progress cannot be edited), or deleted.

On the “Add Rubrics” page, administrators can add two types of items: “Criterion” and “Text Box.” They can also set requirements such as “Required” and “Hide Serial Number”, and more.
