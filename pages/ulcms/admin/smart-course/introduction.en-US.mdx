# Introduction

Using the Lecture Capture System, school administrators can watch live courses and recorded playback, view real-time scenes from each classroom, and perform routine course inspections. While watching a live course or playback, they can also evaluate the teaching and complete internal lecture review tasks. Lecture review tasks for other campus roles can be created and managed by administrators.
