# Viewing Resources: Micro Course

Micro course is a type of PowerPoint-like learning content created by using ULearningâ€™s proprietary authoring tool. There are three types of files in ULearning resource library which can be converted into micro courses: ppt, pdf, and image. It is basically a type of slide-based content with voiceover.

### Step 1
Click the View button for the micro course you want to open.
Notes: ULearning micro courses are marked with a little blue player-like icon.

The micro course viewer is very similar to PowerPoint. The interface is straightforward and intuitive:
- To listen to the voiceover, click the Player button.
- Use the Up arrow to return to the previous slide and the Down arrow to the next slide.
- At the bottom, the progress status is displayed.
- To switch to the Slide Sorter view, click the 4 little square button.
