# Courseware Content Types

ULearning allows teachers to create and include various types of content in courseware. Here are the different content types you may encounter:

### 1. Rich text with images, links, etc.

   - This type of content may contain text, images, and hyperlinks.
   - If the page contains this type of content only, the system will record your page learning as completed as you load this page.
