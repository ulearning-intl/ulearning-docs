# Creating Rich Text Content

1. You can use the Rich Text editor tool in the middle to create your courseware content. Just like the MS Word, you can enter text, hyperlinks, images, formula, etc., and even embed an external video from a social media such as YouTube. 

2. You can also use the Content Element tool bar on the right to add videos, audios, documents, exercise questions, annotated audios, and spoken English tests.
