### Step 2 

Click the Create Class button.
- Notes: When you create a course, the system also creates a class named "Default class" for you. This guide shows you how to create an extra class since it is very likely that you'll teach multiple classes for a course during a semester.

From the Create Class popup window:
- Enter the class name, for example, Monday_9am.
  - Notes: You can create multiple classes in one shot. Just make sure to enter each class name per line.
- Check or uncheck the checkbox in front of "Student need approval to join the class."
- Click the Confirm button at the bottom.
