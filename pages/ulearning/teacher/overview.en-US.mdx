**Steps/Tasks**

### LMS Log in
- First things first: Platform URL, your username, and password

### Course Setup
- Before the course starts
- Create course
  - As a new user to use ULearning, this is your starting point
- Create class
  - When you're creating a new course, a default class will also be created for your course.
  - You can create more class(es) as desired
- Enroll students
  - This is usually handled by your school's administrative staff
  - But sometimes, you need to do it too
- Add teacher to course
  - A course can be co-taught or co-managed by multiple teachers.

  - Reusable and sharable digital learning content in HTML format
  - Authored using ULearning proprietary authoring tool: U-Author
  - Structured into 5 layers: Courseware, Module, Topic, Page, and Content Elements (text, images, videos, practice questions, etc.)
  - It could be authored by somebody else and then shared with you
  - It can also be co-authored by a team
- Preview courseware
  - View the digital learning content in editing as you were a student
- Publish courseware
  - Make it available to students. Before it is published, only you can see it
