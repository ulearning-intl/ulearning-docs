### Step 3 
On the Set Grading Rules screen, set up the following highlighted items:
- Enter the final possible score in points for this course, for example, 100 points.
- Enter the due date when the teacher has to complete the grading for this course, for example, 12/18/2020 (the last day of the fall semester).
- Select when to post grades:
  - Yes
  - No
  - Only after due date
- Assign a weight to each gradable item. If you assign 0 to an item, it means that you will not count the students' score on this item towards their final grade. By default, the system includes 8 gradable items:
  - Courseware Learning - Module/Topic average
  - Courseware Time - 100 or 0 points (graded based on time spent on learning courseware)
  - Courseware Progress - Counted as a percentage
  - Assignments - Actual points based on the teacher's assigned points
  - Discussions - Graded on total cumulative score with a cap
  - Attendance - Graded on penalty reduction
  - Participation - Graded on total cumulative score with a cap
  - Exams - Actual points based on the teacher's assigned points

### Step 6 
Enter details as desired for the following gradable items:
- Discussions: Enter a value, such as 50. If the total points a student earned from discussions reach or exceed 50, the student will contribute the full points (e.g., 10 points) toward their final course grade. If the earned points are 25 (50% of full discussion points 50), the student will contribute 5 points (50% of full points 10) to their final course grade.
- Attendance: Assign a weight or point contribution toward the course final grade. Set the penalty reduction for listed penalty items. For example, if a student had 1 absence and 1 leave early, they will contribute 3 attendance points to the final course grade. If there are 2 absences and 3 lates, there will be 0 point contribution toward the final course grade.
- Participation: The rule for participation is similar to the rule for discussions.
