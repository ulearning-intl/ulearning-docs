# Colleges – Setting up Academic Groups

For Super Admins to set up and manage academic groups on ULearning, use this function to add, edit, and delete academic groups and sub-groups.

**Key Points:**
- Map the school’s academic groups/sub-groups to ULearning
- It should be based on your school academic structure for teaching
- Can add up to 3 layers of an academic group, usually two layers. For exam,
    - First layer - School/Colleges
    - Second layer - Departments
    - Third layer – Programs/Plans
