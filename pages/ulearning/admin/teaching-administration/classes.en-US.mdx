# Administrative Class Management


An administrative class is different from a course class. It is a cohort of students who entered into the same program in the same admission term. For the administrative purpose, a school may organize this group of students into an administrative class/cohort. They may enroll in the same course class or different course classes. 

If your school uses this type of academic group, then you can use this function to create, edit, and delete the administrative classes:
- Add class
- Import class
- Edit class
- Delete class
- View class roster
