# Creating an Exam Automatically

If you prefer to define the exam structure or use a pre-defined exam structure and have the system automatically generate the exam for you, you can follow these steps:

### Step 1: Access the Random Exam Editor

- From the Exam Bank screen, click the Random Exam button.

Note: This method allows you to create multiple exams in one shot based on the same exam structure. These exams can be used in the same exam offering to prevent cheating. The exams generated will be stored in the Exam Bank and can be used multiple times. You can also share these exams with others.

### Step 2: Configure Exam Details

The Random Exam (auto-generate exam) editor will open in a new window.

  - Click the "Add Question Type" link to add a question type to draw [10]. For example, you can add the Multiple Choice type.
    - Enter the number of questions to draw [11].
    - Enter the points for each question [12].
  - Repeat the "Add Question Type" step to add more question types.
  - To add another section, click the "+Add a new section" link.
  - If you want to save the structure as a template for future use, check the "Save the template after generating the exam" checkbox.
- Click the Submit button to generate the exam.

### Step 3: View the Generated Exam
