# Monitoring Exam and Viewing Exam Log

When the anti-cheating features are enabled, all monitoring data is recorded and displayed in real-time for each student. To view a student's exam log and monitor their behavior, follow these steps:

Step 1: Viewing a Student's Exam Log

- Click on the student you wish to view [1].
- Pay close attention to students who have been marked by the system with suspicious behavior(s) [2].

- The log records the device/IP address the student is using to take the exam [1].
- If Camera Monitoring is enabled, the device's front-facing camera will randomly take photos every 2-5 minutes. These photos capture snapshots of the student's gestures/movements at that moment. As a teacher/proctor, you can review these photos during or after the exam to identify cheating or suspicious behaviors. You can click on a captured snapshot to enlarge the photo for a closer review [2].
- Suspicious behavior(s) are automatically identified and marked by the system [3].
- If you want to delete all the photos captured for a specific student after completing the review, click the "Delete Photo" button.

Step 2: Deleting Photos and Exporting Monitoring Information

- To delete all the photos captured for all students in the entire session, click the "Delete Image" button [1].
- To save the exam log on your local computer, click the "Export Monitoring Information" button [2].

By following these steps, you can effectively monitor students' behavior during the exam and review their exam logs. The exam log provides valuable information, including device/IP records and camera monitoring snapshots, to identify any suspicious behavior or cheating attempts. You also have the option to delete photos and export monitoring information for further analysis or record-keeping purposes. This comprehensive monitoring system enhances exam security and helps maintain the integrity of the assessment process.
