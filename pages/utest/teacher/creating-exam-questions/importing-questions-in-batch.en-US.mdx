- The template allows you to add up to 200 questions at a time.
- All fields marked with an asterisk (*) are required. Some fields without an asterisk might still be required for certain question types. Refer to the instructions below to identify these fields.
- The template supports the import of seven question types: Multiple Choice, Multiple Response, True/False, Fill in the Blank, Short Answer, Sequence, and Combination.

- Combination questions are questions with multiple sub-questions. The sub-questions must be one of the six question types mentioned above (Multiple Choice, Multiple Response, True/False, Fill in the Blank, Short Answer, and Sequence).
- The template screenshot above includes a sample combination question and its sub-questions highlighted in blue.
- For Combination questions, you do not need to fill in the Difficulty, Share, and Related Module fields for the sub-questions.
- The Serial No field is used to differentiate Combination questions from other types of questions. The Combination question and its sub-questions should have the same Serial No.
- The Points field is required. If left empty or with an invalid value, the system will assign 2 points by default. For Combination questions, enter the points for each sub-question, and the system will calculate the total for the combination question.
- Enter a value from 1 to 5 in the Difficulty field: 1 = Very easy, 2 = Easy, 3 = Average, 4 = Difficult, 5 = Very difficult.
- The Share field can have values: Private, Selected teachers, School teachers, or All teachers.
- Use the "Courseware name>Module name" format for the Related Module field (optional). For example: "Insurance 101>Introduction" means the question is related to the "Introduction" module of the "Insurance 101" courseware.
- The Tag field (optional) is used for search and classification. Enter up to 3 tags, each tag should be less than 11 characters, separated by # without spaces. For example: "Insurance#Coverage#Discount".
- The Answer field:
  - Multiple Choice: a single letter from A to O (capitalized).
  - Multiple Response: letters from A to O (capitalized) separated by a semicolon (;) without spaces.
  - True/False: True or False.
  - Fill in the Blank: the answer for each blank separated by a semicolon (;) without spaces.
  - Sequence: letters from A to O (capitalized) in order and separated by a semicolon (;) without spaces.
- The Question Stem field: Use five consecutive underscores (_____) to represent a blank. For example: "San Francisco is a city in _____ state. The state's capital city is _____."
- The Choice A-O fields: Support up to 15 choice fields and are required for Multiple Choice, Multiple Response, and Sequence questions or sub-questions.
- The Question Instructions field is only required for Combination questions, and you can leave it empty for other question types.
