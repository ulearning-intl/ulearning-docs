# Duplicating Questions

You have the option to create your own exam questions by duplicating questions that have been created by the school or shared by others. Here's how you can duplicate questions:

### Step 1: Access the Question Bank

- You can duplicate questions from either the School Question Bank [1] or the Shared Question Bank [2]. Let's take duplicating questions from the Shared Question Bank as an example.
- On the Question Bank screen, click the Shared Question Bank button [2].

### Step 2: Duplicate Questions

- In the Shared Question Bank, you can choose to duplicate a single exam question or duplicate a whole folder of exam questions.
- Locate the question or folder you want to duplicate, and then click the Copy button. This will duplicate the question or the folder along with all the questions inside it, and they will be added to your question bank.

By duplicating questions, you can quickly create your own set of questions based on existing ones from the School Question Bank or the Shared Question Bank. This allows you to customize and adapt the questions to your specific needs without starting from scratch.
