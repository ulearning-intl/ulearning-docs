**Tips:**
- You can create your own template using the question templates provided in the Question Editor and save it as a Word document on your local computer. Whenever you want to add exam questions to the Question Bank, you can quickly create these questions using your own template and then copy and paste them into the Question Editor.
- This method supports only five types of questions. For your convenience, the templates for these five types are listed below. You can copy and paste them into a Word document or Notepad document to create your own template.

### Template Examples:

```
1. (2) Multiple Choice question placeholder
   *
   (*) Choice 1 placeholder

   ## Answer Explanation placeholder (Optional)

   ## Feedback placeholder (Optional)

5. (1) Short Answer question placeholder

```

**Notes:**

- A number inside parentheses in front of the question stem represents the points assigned to the question. For example, (2) means the question has 2 points, and you can edit the number as desired.
- A standalone * mark after the question stem indicates that it is either a Multiple Choice or Multiple Response question.
- A * inside parentheses in front of an answer choice indicates that the choice is a correct answer. For example, (*) Choice 1 placeholder. You can move or delete it to reselect the correct answer choice(s).
- The placeholder after ## is for the Answer Explanation, which serves as learning reinforcement. Students can view the answer explanation after submission, but it is optional. You can either delete the placeholder after ## or replace it with your actual content.
- In the Fill in the Blank question stem, a set of parentheses ( ) represents a blank. The content after (*) = indicates the answer for the question, and the answers are separated by || if the question has multiple blanks.
- The Short Answer question placeholder allows for a single answer placeholder.
- The ## Feedback placeholder is optional and can be used for providing feedback on the question.
