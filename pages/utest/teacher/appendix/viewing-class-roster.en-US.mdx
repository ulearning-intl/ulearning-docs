**Note:** 
- The process described in this guide allows you to add students to the class manually. Typically, students are registered by the school's administrative staff. This guide simply demonstrates that you have the ability to add students to the class independently.
- There are alternative methods to add students, which are explained in detail in the complete version of the ULearning Teacher Guide.

By following these steps, you can easily view the roster of students for a specific class in ULearning. This allows you to keep track of the students enrolled in each class section or session within a course.
