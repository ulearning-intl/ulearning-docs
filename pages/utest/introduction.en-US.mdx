# UTest Introduction

## Overview
The U-Test is an online exam system developed by ULearning Technology. It encompasses the entire process of online testing, including question creation, exam creation, exam offering/session creation, exam facility scheduling, exam delivery (hosting/taking exam), exam proctoring, exam grading, and exam data analysis and reporting.

The U-Test supports online exams that can be taken virtually via a PC or mobile device, as well as exams conducted in testing facilities such as on-campus classrooms/computer labs or off-campus testing centers.

By default, the U-Test is the exam function of ULearning Learning Management System (ULearning LMS), but it can also be used as a standalone system or integrated with other popular LMS platforms.

This guide is specifically focused on using U-Test as the exam function of ULearning LMS. Guides for other scenarios may have slight differences.

## High-Level U-Test Process
To offer an exam with ULearning LMS, the exam needs to be associated with a course. To take the associated exam, a student must be enrolled in a class offered by the course. Assuming the course/class has already been created and students are enrolled, here is the high-level exam process:

1. Creating exam questions:
   - Questions can be created or added in four different ways:
     - Create questions one by one manually (Question Editor)
     - Create questions in batch by clicking to insert or by copy/paste (Question Editor)
     - Import questions in batch (Question Import Template)
     - Duplicate questions created by the school or others (Question Bank)
2. Creating the exam:
   - Exams can be created in three different ways:
     - Manually created exam
     - Automatically created exam
     - Random exam (instantly created when the exam is delivered based on an exam structure)
3. Creating the course exam offering/session (may include facility scheduling)
4. Delivering/Hosting the exam:
   - The exam can be delivered/hosted in two ways:
     - Virtually long distance
     - From an on-campus classroom/computer lab or off-campus testing center
5. Taking the exam (Students):
   - Students can take the exam from PCs or mobile devices.
6. Proctoring the exam - Anti-Cheating:
   - Various measures can be taken to prevent cheating, including:
     - Face Verification
     - Lockdown Browser (Under testing)
     - Monitoring: Device, IP, and Behavior
7. Grading the exam:
   - The exam can be graded automatically or manually.
8. Viewing/Exporting exam results:
   - Teachers can view the results and export scores, responses, and custom results.
9. Viewing/Exporting Analysis Report (Teachers - Analysis Report)

In the following sections, we will provide detailed instructions for each of these steps.

- If you need guidance on creating a course/class and enrolling students, refer to the appendix of this guide on Page 85 for a short section on how to do it.
